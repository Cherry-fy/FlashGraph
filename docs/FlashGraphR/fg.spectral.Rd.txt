Perform spectral clustering

Description:

     Spectral clustering partitions an undirected graph into k groups
     based on an embedding of the graph, which computes eigenvectors
     from a variant of the adjacency matrix of the graph. Spectral
     clustering runs KMeans clustering on eigenvectors.

Usage:

     fg.spectral.clusters(fg, k, ase)
     
Arguments:

      fg: The FlashGraphR object of the undirected graph.

       k: The number of clusters.

     ase: The function computes spectral embedding and generates
          eigenvectors.

Value:

     A vector of integers (from '1:k') indicating the cluster to which
     each vertex belongs to.
