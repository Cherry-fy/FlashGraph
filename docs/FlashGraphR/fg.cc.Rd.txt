Connected components of a graph

Description:

     Compute all (weakly or strongly) connected components of a graph.

Usage:

     fg.clusters(graph, mode = c("weak", "strong"))
     
Arguments:

   graph: The FlashGraphR object

    mode: Character string, either "weak" or "strong". For directed
          graphs "weak" implies weakly, "strong" strongly c components
          to search. It is ignored for undirected graphs.

Details:

     For an undirected graph, this function only computes connected
     components and ignores the argument `mode'.

     For strongly connected components, we use a customized version of
     the algorithm described in the paper

Value:

     A numeric vector that indicates the cluster id to which each
     vertex blongs to.
