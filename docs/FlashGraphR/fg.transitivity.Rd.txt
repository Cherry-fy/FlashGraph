Transitivity of a graph

Description:

     Transitivity measures the probability that the adjacent vertices
     of a vertex are connected. This is sometimes also called the
     clustering coefficient.

Usage:

     fg.transitivity(graph, type = c("global", "local"))
     
Arguments:

   graph: The FlashGraphR object

    type: The type of the transitivity measure

Details:

     There are essentially two types of transitivity measures, one is a
     vertex-level, the other a graph level property. This function can
     compute both types of transitivity measures and works for both
     directed and undirected graphs.

Value:

     A numeric vector that contains transitivity of each vertex if
     `type' is "local" and a single value if `type' is "global".
