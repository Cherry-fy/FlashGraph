Locality statistic

Description:

     Compute locality statistic of vertices in a graph.

Usage:

     fg.topK.scan(graph, order = 1, K = 1)
     
     fg.local.scan(graph, order = 1)
     
Arguments:

   graph: The FlashGraphR object

   order: An integer scalar, the size of the local neighborhood for
          each vertex. Should be non-negative.

Details:

     `fg.topK.scan' finds the top K vertices with the largest locality
     statistics in a graph and computes their locality statistic.

     `fg.local.scan' computes locality statistic of each vertex in a
     graph.

     Locality statistic is defined as the number of edges in the
     neighborhood of a vertex.

Value:

     A numeric vector that contains locality statistic of each vertex.
