Graph information

Description:

     Functions for providing the basic information of a graph.

Usage:

     fg.vcount(graph)
     
     fg.ecount(graph)
     
     fg.in.mem(graph)
     
     fg.is.directed(graph)
     
Arguments:

     The: FlashGraphR object

Details:

     `fg.vcount' gets the number of vertices in a graph.

     `fg.ecount' gets the number of edges in a graph.

     `fg.in.mem' indicates whether a graph is stored in memory.

     `fg.is.directed' indicates whether a graph is directed.

Value:

     `fg.vcount' and `fg.ecount' returns integer constants. `fg.in.mem'
     and `fg.is.directed' returns boolean constants.
