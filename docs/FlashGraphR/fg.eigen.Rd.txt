Eigensolver

Description:

     Compute eigenvalues/vectors of the adjacency matrix of an
     undirected graph.

Usage:

     fg.eigen(graph, which = "LM", nev = 1, ncv = 2)
     
Arguments:

   graph: The FlashGraphR object

   which: Specify which eigenvalues/vectors to compute, character
          constant with exactly two characters. Possible values for
          symmetric input matrices: "LA' Compute 'nev' largest
          (algebraic) eigenvalues. "SA" Compute "nev" smallest
          (algebraic) eigenvalues. "LM" Compute `nev' largest (in
          magnitude) eigenvalues. "SM" Compute `nev' smallest (in
          magnitude) eigenvalues.

     nev: Numeric scalar. The number of eigenvalues to be computed.

     ncv: Number of Lanczos vectors to be generated.

Details:

     This implements Implicitly Restart Lanczos method described in the
     paper

     D. Calvetti and L. Reichel and D. C. Sorensen: An Implicitly
     Restarted Lanczos method for Large Symmetric Eigenvalue problems,
     Jounral of ETNA, 1994.

Value:

     A named list with the following members: values: Numeric vector,
     the desired eigenvalues.  vectors: Numeric matrix, the desired
     eigenvectors as columns.
