Diameter estimation

Description:

     Estimate the diameter of a graph, the longest distance between two
     vertices in a graph.

Usage:

     fg.diameter(graph, directed = FALSE)
     
Arguments:

   graph: The FlashGraphR object

directed: Indicates whether or not to respect the direction of edges in
          a graph when traversing the graph. It is ignored for
          undirected graphs.

Details:

     This implementation uses the double sweep method described in the
     paper below to estimate the lower bound of the diameter.
