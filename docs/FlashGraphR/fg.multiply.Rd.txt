Sparse matrix multiplication

Description:

     Multiply a sparse matrix with a dense vector or a dense matrix.

Usage:

     fg.multiply(graph, vec, transpose = FALSE)
     
     fg.multiply.matrix(graph, m, transpose = FALSE)
     
Arguments:

   graph: The FlashGraphR object

     vec: A numueric vector

transpose: Indicate whether or not to multiply with the transpose of
          the matrix. It is ignored by an undirected graph.

       m: A numeric dense matrix.

Details:

     `fg.multiply' multiplies a sparse matrix with a dense vector.

     `fg.multiply.matrix' multiplies a sparse matrix with a dense
     matrix.

     Note that the sparse matrix is represented by a graph. A symmetric
     matrix is represented by an undirected graph and an asymmetric
     matrix is represented by a directed graph. For an asymmetric
     matrix, we can multiply the vector with the transpose of the
     matrix without really transposing the matrix. Right now it only
     supports multiplication on the adjacency matrix of the graph.

Value:

     `fg.multiply' returns a numeric vector and `fg.multiply.matrix'
     returns a numeric dense matrix.
