Triangle counting

Description:

     Count the number of triangles on each vertex in a graph.

Usage:

     fg.triangles(graph, type = "cycle")
     
Arguments:

   graph: The FlashGraphR object

    type: The type of triangles. It is ignored for undirected graphs.

Details:

     Triangle counting works for both directed and undirected graphs.
     For directed graphs, this counts the number of cycle triangles,
     shown below. A -> B ^ / | v C

Value:

     A numeric vector that contains the number of triangles associated
     with each vertex.
