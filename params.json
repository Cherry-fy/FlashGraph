{"name":"Flashgraph","tagline":"A SSD-based graph processing engine for billion-node graphs","body":"### Welcome to FlashGraph.\r\nFlashGraph is a SSD-based graph processing framework that is capable of processing billion-node graphs on a single commodity machine. FlashGraph seeks performance, capacity, flexibility and ease of programming. It has performance comparable to the state-of-art in-memory graph engines while scaling to graphs with hundreds of billions of edges or even trillions of edges. Furthermore, it can express varieties of algorithms in FlashGraph and hide the complexity of accessing data on SSDs and parallelizing graph algorithms.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with FlashGraph? Check out the documentation at https://github.com/icoming/FlashGraph/wiki or post issues at https://github.com/icoming/FlashGraph/issues and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
